A very simple calculator app made programmatically in MATLAB. To use this app, create a new blank project in MATLAB, add all of the .m files from this repository to the project files so that they are all in the same folder, 
and then run by either:  (1.) Opening 'CalculatorApp.m' and pressing the run button found in the editor tab, or (2.) type 'myCalculator = CalculatorApp();' in the command window.
