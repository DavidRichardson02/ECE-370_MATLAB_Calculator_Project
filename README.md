A very simple calculator app made programmatically in MATLAB. To use this app, create a new blank project in MATLAB, add all of the .m files from this repository to the project files so that they are all in the same folder, 
and then run by either:  (1.) Opening 'CalculatorApp.m' and pressing the run button found in the editor tab, or (2.) type 'myCalculator = CalculatorApp();' in the command window.


              NOTE: Does NOT contain functionality for: handling negatives, any trigonometry, any conversion of units, order of operations, intervals, error correction, any sort of grid layouts(and by extension automatic 
              space partitions for components and their interface elements, meaning they are positioned by hard coded values here), plus a ton of quality of life stuff.

  
Overall an extremely rough around the edges calculator app that really shouldn't be used as anything other than a starting point for getting familiar with the MATLAB syntax(especially with regards to interactive apps).
ALSO, the logic for the RelationalSymbols class's interface elements has not been implemented, but the buttons do work.
